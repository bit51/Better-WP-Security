## Formally Better WP Security ##

## [4.x Branch Ready For Testing] (https://github.com/ithemes/iThemes-Security/tree/4.x)
I'm happy to announce that the [4.x branch] (https://github.com/ithemes/iThemes-Security/tree/4.x) has enough in it to start testing. If you have a minute or 6 please download it and start submitting your issues.

### Welcome to the iThemes Security Development Repository

WordPress core might be secure, but many plugins and users don't always maintain the same level of security. iThemes Security aims to fix some of the issues caused by things other than WordPress core.
